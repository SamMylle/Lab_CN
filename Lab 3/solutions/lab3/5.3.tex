When Router1 receives the ICMP request for subnet $10.0.3.0/24$, it determines that the request should not be sent to himself, but to another host (namely Router2's vlan1 interface). Router1 will inform PC2 of this, by sending a redirect ICMP message (as captured in Wireshark). All the captured packets can be found at "traces/5.6.pcapng".
