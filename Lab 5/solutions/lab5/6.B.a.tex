After a while, some ACK's and data packets get retransmitted. The serial link could not keep up with the traffic. The sender didn't receive the ACK in time, and therefor retransmits his data packets. On the other hand, the receiver doesn't receive data for some time and assumes the ACK has been lost and resends it.
