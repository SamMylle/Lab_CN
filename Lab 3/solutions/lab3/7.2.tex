For the first scenario (step 3) the ping would have failed. PC3 would not have been able to know where to sent the reply packet to because PC1 is located on another subnet, not visible to PC3. \\ \\
The second scenario (step 4) would still work: PC3 can see PC4 and therefor send packets directly. \\ \\
The last scenario (step 5) would fail. PC3 cannot see PC2 directly. A ping could not be sent by PC3 for this reason. The default gateway made it so PC3 could send the ICMP packets through the router to PC2.
