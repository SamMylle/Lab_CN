Each routing table entry consumes 20 bytes. They contain information about the Address Family (in our case IP), the Route Tag (in order to differentiate between different protocols if necessary), the IP address of the routing table entry, the netmask associated with the IP address, the next hop address and the metric for that route (hop count).
