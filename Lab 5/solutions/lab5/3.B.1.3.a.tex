No IP fragmentation can be observed on the 10.0.1.0/24 network. This is because TCP negotiates maximum segment size based on MTU of the link. In this case the maximum segment size gets set to 460 bytes, because the MTU on the 10.0.2.0/24 for PC2 is 500 bytes and the connection runs across the 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24 networks. The application data is segmented in TCP, and therefore no IP fragmentation occurs.
