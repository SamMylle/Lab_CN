TCP delays ACKs so that they may be sent together with other ACKs or so that they can be piggybacked. This reduces the overhead of TCP. \\
Because the ACKs get piggybacked here, we can't calculate the maximum delay, but we can get a lower and upper bound for the delays.
According to RFC 1122, this delay may be at most 500 ms. \\
The delay time ranges (in this example) from 0.33 ms (as seen in packets 60 and 61) to 42 ms (as seen in packets 48 and 49).
As we can see in the other packets, the delays are rather close to 0.33 ms and rather far from 42 ms.
