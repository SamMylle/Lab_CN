$19.516716574 - 18.285926392 = 1.230790182$ seconds for the FTP transfer, $138.673506602 - 136.988383918 = 1.685122684$ seconds for the TFTP transfer. For simplicity's sake we will define an $ACK time$ as the $propagation delay$ + an ACK packet's $transmission delay$. The results above can be explained as follows: FTP can transfer TCP segments without having to wait for acknowledgements (TCP delayed ACK), which leads to it reducing time spent on waiting for acknowledgements by $(n-1) * ACK time$ when able to send $n$ packets without acknowledgement. This leads to a total of $ceil(\dfrac{packets sent}{n}) * ACK time$ when transfering data. For TFTP this $n$ is $1$, and therefore for every packet it sends it must receive an ACK, leading to $packets sent * ACK time$ delay.
