The first part of an entry describes the type of route. In our case we have either C or S
(C meaning that the route to the subnet is directly connected to the interface , S meaning
that the entry is static (added by us)). The second part ($10.0.x.0$ is directly connected...) describes on which interface packets should be routed, according to the subnet.
