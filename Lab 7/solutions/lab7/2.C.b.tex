When the renew time is hit, the client will start sending DHCP requests to the DHCP server. When the server is not reachable, the client will keep doing this untill he hits the expire time. When the expire time is hit, the client will release his acquired ip address from the server, and start looking for a renewed DHCP server (TODO state which packets for discovery).
