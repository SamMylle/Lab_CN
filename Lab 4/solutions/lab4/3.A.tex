The updating of the routing tables happened very quickly (it was already updated the moment we checked the routing tables after connecting Router 4). As soon as Router 4 connected to the network, it sent a RIP request message. After receiving the responses from the other routers, Router 4 informed the other routers and hosts about his (updated) routing table.
