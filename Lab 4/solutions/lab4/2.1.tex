\textit{the captured RIP packet.}

\\ \\ The RIP message starts with the command that the protocol issues. In this case, the command is Response, as a reply to the Request command of the previous packet. Following that is the version of RIP that is used (version 2 in this packet). After this you have a list of all the IP addresses that the host/router knows, providing routing information to the host/router that sent the request.
