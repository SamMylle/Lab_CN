The inside local address is assigned to a machine inside a network. This IP address is unique within this network, but might not be unique outside of the network.
Therefore, a router on which NAT is enabled will replace this local address with an inside global address.
An outside global address is public, and it is reachable through the internet. \\
The outside local address is the real IP address of the machine in another NAT network.
