An autonomous system is a collection of connected nodes with a clearly defined routing policy. It is under control of a single administravtive entity. \\
These autonomous systems communicate internally. These autonomous systems are responsible for routing packets to the nodes within this system. \\
But, these domains also communicate with each other. So it's possible for a node in autonomous system A to send packets to autonomous system B.
