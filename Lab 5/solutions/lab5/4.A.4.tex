The packets involved in closing the TCP connection are packets with both the FIN and ACK flags set, and a last ACK (packet 84 - 86 in 4-a.6.pcapng) The ACK flags acknowledge the receiving of previous packets, where the FIN flags denote the end of the TCP connection. The client's FIN flag gets replied to by the server's ACK with the FIN flag set, denoting the connection on the server's end is closing too. This then gets acknowledged by the client sending an ACK to the server.
