After receiving a packet, the receiver sends an acknowledgement to the sender. \\
Assume some packet has been lost. In the meantime the receiver receives the packets that followed the lost packet.
After receiving these packets, the receiver sends an acknowledgement, but still only for the sequence number of the lost packet (indicating it still has to receive this packet).
This results in duplicate acknowledgments. \\
Fast retransmit works as follows: if the sender receives a specified number (assume 3) of acknowledgements with the same acknowledge number, the sender will retransmit the packet that was lost before waiting for its timeout.
Fast recovery works as follows: if the sender receives a specified number of acknowledgements (assume 3) with the same acknowledge number, it sets the slow start treshold to half of the congestion window.
Then, it retransmits the lost packet, sets its congestion window (= cwnd) to cwnd + 3 and continues with slow start.
Once you receive an ACK that acknowledges all packets sent between the lost packet and the first reception of a duplicate ACK, exit fast recovery (set cwnd to the slow start treshold).
