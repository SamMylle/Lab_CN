The files with the captured data can be found at "/traces/8.pcap" and "/traces/8.txt".
The difference between the tcpdump file and the wireshark file is that wireshark dissects every bit of the packet. Every bit/sequence of bits in the packet is analyzed and interpreted. As a result of that, the ethernet header is also analyzed, as opposed to tcpdump.
