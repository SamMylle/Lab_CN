While routers are layer 3 devices which connect networks, bridges/switches are layer 2 devices which connect networks. In practice this means that routers forward data based on the layer 3 protocol that is used, where bridges/switches forward data based on the hardware address (MAC address). Bridges/switches can therefore let two networks act as one towards layer 3.
