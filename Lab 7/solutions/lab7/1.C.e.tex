When a packet has to go outside the private network:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inspect the source address and port of the packet.
\item Lookup the entry in the NAT table where the non-translated address and port equal the address and port found above.
\item Extract the translated address and port in the entry found above.
\item Replace the source address and source port in the outgoing packet (using the address and port in the previous step).
\item Send the packet to its destination (outside the private network).
\end{itemize}

When a packet has to go inside the private network:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inspect the destination address and port of the packet.
\item Lookup the entry in the NAT table where the translated address and port equal the address and port found above.
\item Extract the non-translated address and port in the entry found above.
\item Replace the destination address and destination port in the outgoing packet (using the address and port in the previous step).
\item Send the packet to its destination (within the private network).
\end{itemize}
