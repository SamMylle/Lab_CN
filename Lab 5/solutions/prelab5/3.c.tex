While issuing the following command: ping -c 1 -s 2000 -Mdo 192.168.0.133 \\
We get the following output: \\
PING 192.168.0.133 (192.168.0.133) 2000(2028) bytes of data. \\
ping: local error: Message too long, mtu=1500 \\
 \\
--- 192.168.0.133 ping statistics --- \\
1 packets transmitted, 0 received, +1 errors, 100\% packet loss, time 0ms \\
\\
As you can see, the router informs us that the packet cannot be sent due to its size and the DF bit. The MTU is also returned (here 1500).
