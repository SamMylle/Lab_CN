The netstat command displays a few more statistics of the routing table. First of all it displays the MSS (Maximum Segment Size) for the different routes (0 meaning no changes should be made to the packet size). It also displays the Window, which specifies the default window size. The irtt column specifies the initial round trip time. Lastly the netstat command also shows on which interface the packets should be placed, depending on the destination ip address. \\

The other way around, the "show ip rip" command displays some other additional properties/statistics. This is specifically the tag for the different routes, the timeout time for the routes (Time), and the cost that is associated with the route (Metric).
