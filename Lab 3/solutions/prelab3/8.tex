In order to support $60$ hosts, one would need a network prefix small enough so the host part of the address can identify up to $60$ hosts. As $64$ is the next power of $2$, using up $log_2(64) = 6$ bits, we have $32 - 16 - 6 = 10$ bits left to create networks. As $2^{10}=1024$, we can therefore create $1024$ individual networks, each with a maximum of $64$ hosts.
