The first ping command was successful because the router was directly reachable from the PC. \\
The second ping was successful because of the nat translation. When the ping arrives at Router 2, he translates the source address. The packet is then routed to PC 4 and arrives at its destination. TODO this should fail, no? \\
The third ping was successful because it was in the same network, it didn't leave. \\
The fourth ping was not successful, because PC4 could not route the packet back. \\
The fifth ping was not succesful because no nat entry has been added, no default gw present. The address 10.0.1.2 of PC 3 is not visible outside the NAT network. Therefore, PC 4 won't be able to reach PC 3. If PC 4 would be able to reach PC 3 using 10.0.1.2, this would mean that he can also reach PC 1 using address 10.0.1.2. Of course, this is impossible. \\

The last ping was successful, because of the nat entry at router 2.
