The telnet server sends the client a message containing "Login timed out after 60 seconds.", which gets acknowledged. Afterwards the server sends a packet to the client containing the FIN and ACK flags, which gets responded to by the client with FIN and ACK, which then gets acknowledged by the server. It is now the server initiating the closing of the connection instead of the client.
