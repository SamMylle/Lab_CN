This command shows all the border routers known to Router 1. In case of our topology, the only border router Router 1 knows of is PC1. PC1's Link State ID is 10.0.1.1, which can be reached by sending to address 10.0.2.1 (interface eth1 of PC1) via Router 1's vlan1 interface. The route is an intra-area route, meaning that the route doesn't leave the area (area 1 in this case).
