Assume you have data to send. \\
If the window size allows it and if the available data is larger than the maximum segment size, then you shoud send a complete segment now (with a size of "maximum segment size"). \\
If the above does not hold and there is still unconfirmed data, then you have to enqueue the data in the buffer until an acknowledgment is received. \\
If the above does not hold, then you just have to send the data immediately. \\
\\
The reason this algoritmh is used is because it sends small packets together in a full packet's worth of output. This reduces the overhead of acknowledgments. \\
For example: if you send 8 small packets, the receiver has to send 8 acknowledgments. If you send those 8 small messages in one packet, the sender only has to send one acknowledgment.
