The 10.0.0.0/8 block, the 127.16.0.0/12 block and the 192.168.0.0/16 block are private IPv4 address blocks. One of the reasons for this is the IPv4 address space exhaustion. Because of these address blocks, there can be multiple private networks with the same IP addresses distributed amongst the hosts. Thanks to NAT (and PAT), these hosts can still connect to the public network.
