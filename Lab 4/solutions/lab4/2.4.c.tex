We observed 2 types of RIP messages: Requests and Responses. A router that connects to the network the first time (or enables RIP at an arbitrary time), sends a request message to all its neighbouring routers by sending a multicast packet. The routers which receive this request answer with a Response message, containing their respective routing tables. Response messages are also sent periodically.
