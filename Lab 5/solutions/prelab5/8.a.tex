A sender and a receiver both have a window size N. \\
Whenever a sender has data to send, he checks the window size, the sequence number of the packet to be sent ($n_s$) and the highest sequence number that was acknowledged by the receiver ($n_a$.
When $n_a$ < $n_s$ < N + $n_a$, the sender may send the packet. \\
The receiver will only accept packets the same way the sender checks if he can send the packet. \\
Whenever a receiver receives and accepts a packet, he will update his $n_a$. \\
Whenever a sender receives an acknowledgment, he will update his $n_a$.
