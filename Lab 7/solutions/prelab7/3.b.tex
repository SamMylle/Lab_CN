A dynamic NAT is a type of NAT where there's a pool of public addresses available, and a set of private hosts. When a private host connects to the global internet, its address is mapped to one of the available public addresses. When it disconnects, the public address is freed and ready to use by another private host. This masks the internal network configuration very effectively, but it is limited by the amount of available public addresses.
