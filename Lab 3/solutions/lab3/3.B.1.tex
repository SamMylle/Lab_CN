Traceroute sends 3 packets for each TTL increasing from 1 to 30 or until it has reached its destination. It targets an unused port so the destination does not interpret it as a valuable data packet. Traceroute can then determine the route based on the ICMP messages generated by the TTL of the packets expiring, and it will know it has reached its destination when it receives a port unreachable message.
