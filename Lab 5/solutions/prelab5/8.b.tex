Slow start begins with a congestion window size that will be incremented every time an ACK is received. \\
When a packet is lost or the receiver advertised a limiting window size or the slow start treshold is reached, the window will not be increased when receiving an ACK. \\
On packet loss, TCP takes steps to reduce the load. \\
When the slow start treshold is reached, the congestion window will increase by one every round-trip time.
