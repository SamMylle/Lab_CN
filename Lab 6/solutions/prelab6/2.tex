An ethernet hub is a device which passes on all data it receives to all connected devices, whereas an ethernet switch learns which devices are connected on which ports and then forwards data accordingly. For higher traffic loads, it is better to choose an ethernet switch over an ethernet hub as the hub can create a lot of overhead by essentially broadcasting everything it receives, instead of only forwarding the data on the correct port.
