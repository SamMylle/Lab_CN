The first ping command was successful because the router was directly reachable from the PC. \\
The second ping was successful because of the nat translation (TODO elaborate).
The third ping was successful because it was in the same network, didn't leave.
The fourth ping was not successful, because PC4 could not route the packet back.
The fifth ping was not succesful because no nat entry has been added, no default gw present (TODO elaborate).

The last ping was successful, because of the nat entry at router 2.
