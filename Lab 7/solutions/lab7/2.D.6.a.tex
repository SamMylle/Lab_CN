The DHCP relay server kind off modifies both, dependent on where the packet came from. \\
The relay server adjusts the client packets to a unicast packet straight to the DHCP server. It uses port 67 as source, since it is a server. It also modifies the DHCP header slightly, by filling in the relay agent IP address as its own, and adjusting the hop count. \\ 
As for packets received from the DHCP server, it only modifies the IP header to send the packet to the DHCP client.
