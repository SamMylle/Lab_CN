In the Discover packet we observe 4 options: \\
\begin{itemize}
	\item DHCP Message Type: in this case Discover
	\item Host Name: the name of the host
	\item Parameter Request List: a list of all the parameters that the client wants. This varies from subnet mask, broadcast address, ... to server addresses, network settings, etc.
	\item End: the end of the options
\end{itemize}

The Offer packet also has a message type and end option. Other than that, it contains options/information about the router, subnet mask, IP address lease time and DHCP server identifier. \\ \\

The Request packet uses the same options as the Discover packet, with the addition of a Requested IP Address option. This last option specifies the ip address the client wants. \\ \\

The ACK package has the same options as the Offer packet (no additional ones).
