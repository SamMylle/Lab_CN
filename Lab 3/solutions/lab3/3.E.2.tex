The echo request travels as far as the Cisco router. At PC1, the request is put on the
default gateway (to PC2). At PC2, the packet is put on the default gateway aswell (to the Cisco router). The request cannot be routed further at the router, since there is no entry
that corresponds to the destination address. \\
The requests messages were seen at PC1 and PC2 ("traces/3-E.5.PC1.pcapng" and "traces/3-
E.5.PC2.pcap"). \\
\textit{When setting the default gateway, the pcs tried checking for updates, sending traffic to ubuntu archives.}
